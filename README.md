# Short-term-Load-Forecasting
Short-term load forecasting (STLF) in machine learning involves predicting the electricity demand for a short time horizon, typically ranging from a few hours to a few days ahead. The goal is to provide accurate and timely predictions of power consumption, enabling efficient energy management and grid operation.
